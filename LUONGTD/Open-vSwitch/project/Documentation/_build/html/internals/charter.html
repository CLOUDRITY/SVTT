<h1>The Linux Foundation Open vSwitch Project Charter<a class="headerlink" href="#the-linux-foundation-open-vswitch-project-charter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Effective August 9, 2016</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Mission of Open vSwitch Project (“OVS”).</p>
<p>The mission of OVS is to:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>create an open source, production quality virtual networking
platform, including a software switch, control plane, and
related components, that supports standard management interfaces
and opens the forwarding functions to programmatic extension and
control; and</li>
<li>host the infrastructure for an OVS community, establishing a
neutral home for community assets, infrastructure, meetings,
events and collaborative discussions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Technical Steering Committee (“TSC”)</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>A TSC shall be composed of the Committers for OVS. The list of Committers
on the TSC are available at <a class="reference internal" href="maintainers.html"><span class="doc">Committers</span></a>.</li>
<li>TSC projects generally will involve Committers and Contributors:<ol class="lowerroman">
<li>Contributors: anyone in the technical community that
contributes code, documentation or other technical artifacts
to the OVS codebase.</li>
<li>Committers: Contributors who have the ability to commit
directly to a project’s main branch or repository on an OVS
project.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Participation in as a Contributor and/or Committer is open to
anyone under the terms of this Charter.  The TSC may:<ol class="lowerroman">
<li>establish work flows and procedures for the submission,
approval and closure or archiving of projects,</li>
<li>establish criteria and processes for the promotion of Contributors to
Committer status, available at
<a class="reference internal" href="committer-grant-revocation.html"><span class="doc">OVS Committer Grant/Revocation Policy</span></a>. and</li>
<li>amend, adjust and refine the roles of Contributors and Committers
listed in Section 2.b., create new roles and publicly document
responsibilities and expectations for such roles, as it sees fit,
available at <a class="reference internal" href="committer-responsibilities.html"><span class="doc">Expectations for Developers with Open vSwitch Repo Access</span></a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Responsibilities: The TSC is responsible for overseeing OVS
activities and making decisions that impact the mission of OVS,
including:<ol class="lowerroman">
<li>coordinating the technical direction of OVS;</li>
<li>approving project proposals (including, but not limited to,
incubation, deprecation and changes to a project’s charter
or scope);</li>
<li>creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on
cross-project technical issues and requirements;</li>
<li>communicating with external and industry organizations
concerning OVS technical matters;</li>
<li>appointing representatives to work with other open source or
standards communities;</li>
<li>establishing community norms, workflows or policies including
processes for contributing (available at
<a class="reference internal" href="contributing/index.html"><span class="doc">Contributing to Open vSwitch</span></a>), issuing releases, and security
issue reporting policies;</li>
<li>discussing, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting
on technical matters relating to the code base that affect
multiple projects; and</li>
<li>coordinate any marketing, events or communications with
The Linux Foundation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">TSC Voting</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>While it is the goal of OVS to operate as a consensus based
community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move forward,
the Committers shall vote on a one vote per Committer basis.</li>
<li>TSC votes should be conducted by email. In the case of a TSC
meeting where a valid vote is taken, the details of the vote and
any discussion should be subsequently documented for the
community (e.g. to the appropriate email mailing list).</li>
<li>Quorum for TSC meetings shall require two-thirds of the TSC
representatives. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not
met, but shall be prevented from making any decisions requiring
a vote at the meeting.</li>
<li>Except as provided in Section 8.d. and 9.a., decisions by
electronic vote (e.g. email) shall require a majority of all
voting TSC representatives.  Decisions by electronic vote shall
be made timely, and unless specified otherwise, within three (3)
business days. Except as provided in Section 8.d. and 9.a.,
decisions by vote at a meeting shall require a majority vote,
provided quorum is met.</li>
<li>In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that
cannot be resolved by the TSC, any TSC representative shall be
entitled to refer the matter to the Linux Foundation for
assistance in reaching a decision.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Antitrust Guidelines</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>All participants in OVS shall abide by The Linux Foundation
Antitrust Policy available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy</a>.</li>
<li>All members shall encourage open participation from any
organization able to meet the participation requirements,
regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the
community shall not seek to exclude any participant based on any
criteria, requirements or reasons other than those that are
reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all
participants.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Code of Conduct</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>The TSC may adopt a specific OVS Project code of conduct, with approval
from the LF.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Budget and Funding</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>The TSC shall coordinate any budget or funding needs with The
Linux Foundation. Companies participating may be solicited to
sponsor OVS activities and infrastructure needs on a voluntary
basis.</li>
<li>The Linux Foundation shall have custody of and final authority
over the usage of any fees, funds and other cash receipts.</li>
<li>A General &amp; Administrative (G&amp;A) fee will be applied by the
Linux Foundation to funds raised to cover Finance, Accounting,
and operations.  The G&amp;A fee shall equal 9% of OVS’s first
$1,000,000 of gross receipts and 6% of OVS’s gross receipts over
$1,000,000.</li>
<li>Under no circumstances shall The Linux Foundation be expected or
required to undertake any action on behalf of OVS that is
inconsistent with the tax exempt purpose of The Linux
Foundation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">General Rules and Operations.</p>
<p>The OVS project shall be conducted so as to:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>engage in the work of the project in a professional manner
consistent with maintaining a cohesive community, while also
maintaining the goodwill and esteem of The Linux Foundation in
the open source software community;</li>
<li>respect the rights of all trademark owners, including any
branding and usage guidelines;</li>
<li>engage The Linux Foundation for all OVS press and analyst
relations activities;</li>
<li>upon request, provide information regarding Project
participation, including information regarding attendance at
Project-sponsored events, to The Linux Foundation; and</li>
<li>coordinate with The Linux Foundation in relation to any websites
created directly for OVS.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Intellectual Property Policy</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Members agree that all new inbound code contributions to OVS shall be
made under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</a>). All contributions shall be
accompanied by a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
(<a class="reference external" href="http://developercertificate.org">http://developercertificate.org</a>) that is submitted through a TSC and
LF-approved contribution process.</li>
<li>All outbound code will be made available under the Apache
License, Version 2.0.</li>
<li>All documentation will be contributed to and made available by
OVS under the Apache License, Version 2.0.</li>
<li>For any new project source code, if an alternative inbound or
outbound license is required for compliance with the license for
a leveraged open source project (e.g. GPLv2 for Linux kernel) or
is otherwise required to achieve OVS’s mission, the TSC may
approve the use of an alternative license for specific inbound
or outbound contributions on an exception basis. Any exceptions
must be approved by a majority vote of the entire TSC and must
be limited in scope to what is required for such purpose.
Please email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:tsc&#37;&#52;&#48;openvswitch&#46;org">tsc<span>&#64;</span>openvswitch<span>&#46;</span>org</a> to obtain exception approval.</li>
<li>Subject to available funds, OVS may engage The Linux Foundation
to determine the availability of, and register, trademarks,
service marks, which shall be owned by the LF.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Amendments</p>
